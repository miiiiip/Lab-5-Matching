The only methods which contain loops are Swapsies() and matching().
Swapsies will always do 1 or 2 comparisons, depending on whether the first comparison passes.
In matching(), while rowCounter < n^2, it will iterate through each pair, comparing it to every other pair and attempting swapsies on them
This will always need to run n^2 times at least, as that's the number of comparisons necessary to ensure that every pair is satisfactory.
It may run more times than this, but any extra swaps done will only increase the runtime by an additional n or so comparisons.
And as n^2+n E Big Theta(n^2), we believe the time complexity of Matching to be Big O(n^2)
